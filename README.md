# FlowForge
*A Behavioral Project Flow Manager Inspired by Azure Boards*

---

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

**FlowForge** is a project management Web API and UI platform inspired by Azure Boards, but with a fresh twist. It emphasizes the **mental and emotional state of engineering work**, not just task status. This system helps teams track tasks, manage sprints, and gain deeper insights into developer flow, blockers, and productivityâ€”based on *how* work feels, not just *when* it's done.

---

## ðŸš€ Core Concepts

### Emotional Flow States (vs. Traditional Task Status)
- **Inspired** â€“ Youâ€™re excited to start this task.
- **In Flow** â€“ Youâ€™re focused and making progress.
- **Blocked** â€“ Youâ€™re stuck due to an external or technical reason.
- **Frustrated** â€“ Youâ€™re facing repeated issues or scope creep.
- **Complete** â€“ The task is done and verified.

These states allow for a more **empathetic and intelligent workflow** system.
